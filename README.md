# Rice-Rocks
This GitHub repository contains my mini project for Rice University's Fundamentals of Computing specialization on Coursera. Rice Rocks is the final project of the 2nd course of the specialization : "Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python". This course uses its own coding environment named "CodeSkulptor" based on python 2. This two-part course introduces the basic elements of programming. Topics covered include: 

  Statements, expressions, variables
  Functions, logic, conditionals
  Event-driven programming, local/global variables
  Lists, dictionaries, sets
  Classes and object-oriented programming
  Debugging and visualization
  Creating interactive applications in Python

For the last mini-project, I completed the implementation of RiceRocks, an updated version of the arcade game Asteroids. The game has multiple rocks and multiple missiles. You will lose a life if your ship collides with a rock and you will score points if your missile collides with a rock. It keeps track of the score and lives remaining and the game ends at the proper time. Also it has animated explosions when there is a collision.
